#### Storm

##### Non transactional (no ack)
- at most once
- possible data loss

#### Non transactional (with ack)
- at least once
- require explicit retry logic

#### transactional
- exactly once
- works well for batches
- use transactionalTopolicyBuilder
- implement a committer bolt


#### log system
log记录数据的状态，类似于版本控制系统。
mechanics of data flow: log
semantics of details: metadata, schemas, compatibility, all the details of handling data structure and evolution.
pipeline提供统一的数据源，方便加入新的数据处理机制。pipeline负责保证数据的结构正确。

#### Spark
direct kafka keeps 1:1 mapping of each kafka partition to RDD partition in streaming processing. So its better to have more partitions than cores. contains more log lines in a message.
Tune batch interval.
tuen maxrateperpartition to avoid skewed data taking up too much time.
Uniform data distribution.
lambda architecture.
Cassandra is good at write.
