#### Cosmos DB

partition key workload driven schema design. if write heavy then distributed to more partitions, if read heavy then less partitions.
consistent index will automatically index record when written. lazy index will index later.
automatic set to off to turn off indexing  

sproc optimized for transaction not read. read needs client side code. transaction within partition scope. multi-tenant service. nosiy neighborhood.
