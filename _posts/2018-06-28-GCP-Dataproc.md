- Log processing—With minimal modification, you can process large amounts of text log data per day from several sources using existing MapReduce.

- Reporting—Aggregate data into reports and store the data in BigQuery. Then you can push the aggregate data to applications that power dashboards and conduct analysis.

- On-demand Spark clusters—Quickly launch ad-hoc clusters to analyze data is stored in blob storage using Spark (Spark SQL, PySpark, Spark shell).

- Machine learning—Use the Spark Machine Learning Libraries (MLlib), which are preinstalled on the cluster, to customize and run classification algorithms.
